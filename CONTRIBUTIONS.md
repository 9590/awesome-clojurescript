# Contributions

All contributions are welcome!

To keep this guide coherent here are a few guidelines to check before opening pull requests:
- Titles and items should be sorted alphabetically.
- Names should be capitalized unless they contain a dash.
- Descriptions and links should be separated by an en-dash, not a hyphen. You can type en-dash with `‚å• ` + `-` on Macs.
- Summary of changes should be described in commit and pull request messages.

Thank you for reading.
